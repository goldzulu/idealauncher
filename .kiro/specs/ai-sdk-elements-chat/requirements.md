# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing IdeaLauncher chat functionality by implementing AI SDK Elements, which provides a more robust, type-safe, and feature-rich chatbot experience. The current chat implementation has TypeScript compatibility issues and lacks modern chat UI patterns. AI SDK Elements offers pre-built components and hooks that will improve user experience, reduce maintenance overhead, and provide better streaming capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user developing ideas, I want a modern, responsive chat interface that provides real-time AI assistance with proper loading states and error handling, so that I can have a smooth conversation experience while brainstorming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the chat panel THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern chat interface using AI SDK Elements components
2. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL show proper loading indicators during AI response generation
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL stream the response in real-time with smooth text updates
4. WHEN an error occurs during chat THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
5. IF the chat history fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a retry mechanism without breaking the chat interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat to remember our conversation history and maintain context across sessions, so that I can continue developing ideas without losing previous insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user returns to an idea THEN the system SHALL load and display the complete chat history
2. WHEN the user sends a new message THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context from previous messages
3. WHEN the chat history is loaded THEN the system SHALL scroll to the most recent message automatically
4. IF the chat history is empty THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message encouraging the user to start chatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily insert AI-generated content into my idea document, so that I can quickly incorporate valuable insights from our conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI provides a response THEN the system SHALL display an "Insert to Document" button for assistant messages
2. WHEN the user clicks "Insert to Document" THEN the system SHALL add the content to the appropriate section of the idea document
3. WHEN content is inserted THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the insertion
4. IF the insertion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features in the chat, so that I can interact efficiently and the interface is usable for everyone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the designated chat focus shortcut THEN the system SHALL focus the chat input field
2. WHEN the user presses Enter in the input field THEN the system SHALL send the message
3. WHEN the user presses Shift+Enter THEN the system SHALL create a new line in the input
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and announcements for chat messages
5. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL announce them to screen readers appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat implementation to use modern, type-safe patterns with AI SDK Elements, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the chat THEN the system SHALL use AI SDK Elements components and hooks
2. WHEN handling chat state THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript types without any type errors
3. WHEN streaming responses THEN the system SHALL use AI SDK's built-in streaming capabilities
4. WHEN testing the chat THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. IF the AI SDK Elements API changes THEN the system SHALL be easily updatable due to proper abstraction layers
