# Requirements Document

## Introduction

IdeaLauncher is a productivity tool designed for startup founders, indie hackers, and product-minded developers at the earliest stage (pre-product). The platform transforms raw ideas into validated, prioritized, and build-ready specifications through a structured workflow that includes ideation, validation, scoring, MVP planning, and tech stack recommendations. The core value proposition is enabling users to go from a single-line idea to a Kiro-ready spec in ≤ 30 minutes.

The MVP focuses on a chat-plus-canvas workspace where users can capture multiple ideas, research viability through AI-assisted competitor analysis, score and rank ideas using ICE/RICE frameworks, generate lean MVP feature sets, and export comprehensive specifications for immediate implementation.

5. WHEN a user deletes an idea THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and remove all associated data

### Requirement 3: Interactive Chat and AI Assistance

**User Story:** As a product-minded developer, I want to brainstorm and flesh out my ideas through AI-powered conversations, so that I can quickly develop comprehensive concept details.

1. WHEN a user starts a chat session THEN the system SHALL provide streaming AI responses using Azure OpenAI
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL persist the conversation history per idea
3. WHEN a user selects AI-generated content THEN the system SHALL provide an "Insert to Document" option
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL restore the complete chat history and document state
5. WHEN the AI generates content THEN the system SHALL stream responses for real-time interaction

### Requirement 4: Living Document Management

**User Story:** As a founder, I want a single source of truth document that evolves through all phases of idea development, so that all my research and decisions are centralized and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an idea THEN the system SHALL initialize a structured document with sections: Problem, Users, Solution, Features, Research, MVP, Tech, Spec
2. WHEN a user edits the document THEN the system SHALL auto-save changes with timestamp tracking
3. WHEN a user inserts AI content THEN the system SHALL append to the appropriate document section
4. WHEN a user switches between ideas THEN the system SHALL maintain separate document states
5. WHEN a user makes edits THEN the system SHALL support rich-text/Markdown formatting

### Requirement 5: Competitor Research and Market Analysis

**User Story:** As a startup co-founder, I want to research competitors and market opportunities for my idea, so that I can identify gaps and differentiation opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers competitor research THEN the system SHALL generate 3-5 similar tools with names, descriptions, and key features
2. WHEN research is completed THEN the system SHALL allow one-click insertion of findings into the document
3. WHEN a user requests monetization analysis THEN the system SHALL suggest 3-5 viable monetization models with pricing insights
4. WHEN a user generates name ideas THEN the system SHALL propose 8-12 brandable names for the concept
5. WHEN name suggestions are provided THEN the system SHALL check domain availability for .com and .dev extensions

### Requirement 6: Idea Scoring and Prioritization

**User Story:** As an indie founder with multiple ideas, I want to score and rank my concepts using proven frameworks, so that I can objectively prioritize which idea to build first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the scoring panel THEN the system SHALL provide sliders for ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) scoring from 0-10
2. WHEN a user adjusts scores THEN the system SHALL compute and display the composite ICE score in real-time
3. WHEN a user saves scores THEN the system SHALL persist the values and rationale notes
4. WHEN multiple ideas have scores THEN the dashboard SHALL sort by composite score
5. WHEN a user views scoring history THEN the system SHALL show previous scores with timestamps

### Requirement 7: MVP Feature Planning

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to generate a structured MVP plan with prioritized features and estimates, so that I can scope my build appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates MVP features THEN the system SHALL create a MoSCoW prioritized list (Must/Should/Could) with ≤ 10 total items
2. WHEN features are generated THEN the system SHALL provide rough estimates (S/M/L) for each item
3. WHEN MVP planning is complete THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies between features
4. WHEN a user inserts MVP content THEN the system SHALL format as a structured checklist table
5. WHEN estimates are provided THEN the system SHALL include time-to-first-MVP summary

### Requirement 8: Tech Stack Recommendations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-generated tech stack recommendations tailored to my idea, so that I can make informed technology choices for implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests tech stack suggestions THEN the system SHALL recommend specific technologies based on Next.js 15, Vercel, Postgres, Prisma, NextAuth stack
2. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL include 3-5 key implementation tips
3. WHEN tech stack is finalized THEN the system SHALL update the document's Tech section
4. WHEN stack recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL consider the specific requirements of the idea
5. WHEN a user reviews suggestions THEN the system SHALL explain rationale for each technology choice

### Requirement 9: Kiro-Ready Spec Export

**User Story:** As a founder ready to build, I want to export a comprehensive, Kiro-ready specification, so that I can immediately begin implementation without rework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports a spec THEN the system SHALL generate a structured markdown document with Overview, Goals, User Stories, Scope, Non-Functional requirements, Tech Stack, and Milestones
2. WHEN the spec is generated THEN the system SHALL include acceptance criteria for each user story
